    "body": "2023/10/16 - This blog post comes from a copy of a hand written family history that at some point in the past was typed up on a typewriter. I have a copy of both the hand written version (4 pages) and the typed version (3 pages) that I scanned in on 10/16/2023. Below is the text from the typed version, digitized, with minor edits to try to correct text where the OCR couldn’t figure out wording. I have not corrected any grammar. It was typed out in mostly all caps, but I am slowly converting it to sentence case and updating the formatting to make it easier to read. This document I believe was written by Susan Elizabeth Butterbaugh Hammond, she was apparently 80 years old at the time of its writing, so that would have put it around 1938. She passed in 1939.
