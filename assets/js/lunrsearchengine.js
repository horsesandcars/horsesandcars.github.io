    "body": "2023/10/16 - This blog post comes from a copy of a hand written family history that at some point in the past was typed up on a typewriter. I have a copy of both the hand written version (4 pages) and the typed version (3 pages) that I scanned in on 10/16/2023. Below is the text from the typed version, digitized, with minor edits to try to correct text where the OCR couldn’t figure out wording. I have not corrected any grammar. It was typed out in mostly all caps, so I have left it as such.
