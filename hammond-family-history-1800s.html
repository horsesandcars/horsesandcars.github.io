										This blog post comes from a copy of a hand written family
										history that at some point in the past was typed up on a
										typewriter. I have a copy of both the hand written version
										(4 pages) and the typed version (3 pages) that I scanned in
										on 10/16/2023.
									</p>

									<p>
										Below is the text from the typed version, digitized, with
										minor edits to try to correct text where the OCR couldn’t
										figure out wording. I have not corrected any grammar. It was
										typed out in mostly all caps, so I have left it as such.
									</p>

									<p>
										This document I believe was written by Susan Elizabeth
										Butterbaugh Hammond, she was apparently 80 years old at the
										time of its writing, so that would have put it around 1938.
										She passed in 1939.
